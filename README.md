#  Api_Cats 

## This code is a simple Python program that interactively allows users to manage their favorite cat images using the free Cat API.

### 1 Downloading data from the API: The code uses the requests library to communicate with the Cat API and retrieve data on favorite cats and random cat images.

### 2. Interactive user interface: Upon launching the program, the user is prompted to enter a password. If the password is correct, the user can select one of the options:
   
   -> Display favorite cats<br>
   -> Generate a random cat image and add it to favorites<br>
   -> Removing the cat from favorites <br>
   -> Exit the program.

### 3 User Communication: The program uses input and output functions to communicate with the user and interpret his choices accordingly.

### 4. Security: the program requires the user to enter a password at the beginning to access the favorite cat management function. This password is compared with the stored password in the Sensitivedata.credentials file, ensuring that only authorized users can use the program.

### 5 Managing favorite cats: The program allows users to add, delete and view their favorite cats, giving them the flexibility to manage their collection of cat images.
